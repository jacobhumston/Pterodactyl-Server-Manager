# Pterodactyl-Server-Manager

Pterdoactyle Server Manager (PSM) is free to use Discord Bot, which allows you to manage your servers from a Discord Bot. ***Reminder:** PSM requires an API key to work.*

*If you don't know what Pterdoactyle is, please refer to https://pterodactyl.io/.*

> You can create an API key at `https://<panel URL>/account/api`.

Please note that not all hosts allow their users to create API keys, please refer to your host provider for any questions related to restrictions. 

> **Note for administrators of hosts:** PSM is only intended for client use at this time, and only supports client endpoints; `api/client`. Support for the application side of the API may be added later.

Before you are provided with the instructions on how to use PSM, I would like to mention that this project was created as a personal endeavor and can always be improved upon by anyone who would like to do so. If you would like a new feature added, but don't know how to commit such a feature yourself, create an issue.
